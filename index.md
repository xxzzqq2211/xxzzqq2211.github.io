## About Me

I'm currently a Postdoctoral Research Scientist at <a href="https://mreallab.github.io/" target="_blank">MReaL Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Nanyang Technological University</a> from 2022, working with <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/hanwangzhang/" target="_blank">Prof. Hanwang Zhang</a>. I obtained my Ph.D. at <a href="https://www.ntu.edu.sg/" target="_blank">Nanyang Technological University</a> in 2022, advised by <a href="https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/hanwangzhang/" target="_blank">Prof. Hanwang Zhang</a> as well. Prior to the Ph.D., I received B.E. degree in Computer Science from <a href="http://english.seiee.sjtu.edu.cn/english/info/8338.htm" target="_blank">IEEE Pilot Class</a> at <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU)</a> in 2015, and dual-master degree in Computer Science from the joint programme of <a href="https://en.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">SJTU</a> and <a href="https://www.waseda.jp/fsci/gips/en/" target="_blank">Waseda University</a> in 2018, advised by <a href="http://www.waseda.jp/sem-kamlabo011/" target="_blank">Prof. Seiichiro Kamata</a> and <a href="https://dmcv.sjtu.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Prof. Lizhuang Ma</a>.

My research mainly focuses on learning unbiased models against the distribution shift in computer vision, vision
& language, incremental learning, noise identification, etc. As a previous game engineer, my lifelong dream is to (1) use machine learning to create something fun, (2) build interactive, personalized, and engaging NPC that can be used to enable an immersive virtual world.
