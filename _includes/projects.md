    <div class="title">Anthropometric assessment and analysis of asian ears</div>
    <div>The current hearing instrument is designed and tested based on Standard KEMAR Ear, which was initially developed based on males and females from the US Air Force. However, it is unknown whether the Standard KEMAR Ear provide good representation of the polulation across different races and geographical locations. This project aims to construct a standard ear model (including pinna, concha, and external auditory canal) for Asian polulation. </div>
